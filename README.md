# NHL-API
This script is my first code in Github. The aim is to create a script that fetches NHL standings from API-Footnball's NHL API. In the future, I want to be able to fetch player data in real time from some API endpoint to assist me in Fantasy Hockey.
Anyone can use and feel free to edit the code, however you need a Football API access key to use it.
